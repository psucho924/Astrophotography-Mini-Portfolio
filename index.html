          <h2>Deep Sky Astrophotography</h2>
          <p>
            The term Deep Sky Astrophotography refers to image acquisition of
            objects (usually nebulae and galaxies) that are barely visible, if
            not completely invisible to the naked eye. The further away an
            object is, the fainter it usually is, and the “deeper” the
            corresponding image will have to be to make it visible. This often
            requires very many hours of image acquisition with highly sensitive
            precision equipment, in order to reveal, through careful post
            production, the majesty and beauty of the chosen target. For this
            reason, along with the vagaries of the weather in Europe, completed
            images are collected slowly and several months may pass before a new
            image is added to this website.
