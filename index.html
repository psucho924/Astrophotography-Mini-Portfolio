            <h2>Deep Sky Astrophotography</h2>
            <p>
              The term Deep Sky Astrophotography refers to image acquisition of
              objects (usually nebulae and galaxies) that are barely visible, if
              not completely invisible to the naked eye. The further away an
              object is, the fainter it usually is, and the “deeper” the
              corresponding image will have to be to make it visible. This often
              requires very many hours of image acquisition with highly
              sensitive precision equipment, in order to reveal, through careful
              post production, the majesty and beauty of the chosen target. For
              this reason, along with the vagaries of the weather in Europe,
              completed images are collected slowly and several months may pass
              before a new image is added to this website.
